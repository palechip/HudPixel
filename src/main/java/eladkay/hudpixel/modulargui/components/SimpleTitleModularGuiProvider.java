 * intended for usage in this kind of application. By default, all rights are reserved.
 * The original version of the HudPixel Mod is made by palechip and published under the MIT license.
 * The majority of code left from palechip's creations is the component implementation.The ported version to

 * (to be changed to the new license as detailed below in the next minor update).

 * clause is completely cosmetic features. Only the authors may sell cosmetic features for the mod.
 * 4. Every single contibutor owns copyright over his contributed code when separated from HudPixel. When it's part of
 * HudPixel, it is only governed by this license, and any copyright header must indicate that. After the contributed
 * code is merged to the release branch you cannot revoke the given freedoms by this license.
 * 5. If your own project contains a part of the licensed material you have to give the authors full access to all project
 * related files.
 * 6. You shall not act against the will of the authors regarding anything related to the mod or its codebase. The authors
